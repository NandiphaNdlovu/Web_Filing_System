# Web_Filing_System
MAPOLO car repairs garage uses a manual paper filing system to keep car repairs related information such as customer name, car model and repair fee charged. The company wants to change their filing system and make use of technology.
The wed-based application must meet the following:
• Your application must use expressjs and body-parser
• Create three views: index.ejs; form.ejs; 404.ejs
• Create an index view that shows the heading “ Welcome to the homepage of MAPOLO”
• Create a form that will be used to capture car repairs data e.g {Date: 2020/11/06,
‘custName’:’David’,’CarModel’:’BMW’,’fee’:800}
• Use the 404 view for trying to reach an undefined route
• Create the following two routes in your express server:
a) a get route path to URL “/” – render the index views for that path
b) a get route path to URL “/form” – render the form view for that path
• Link the three-view pages
• Use the 404 view for trying to reach an undefined route
• The data that is captured by the form should be displayed in the console.
